Python CopyScriptUsingMD5

link to xkmd picture says it all : https://xkcd.com/1360/

script to copy all files from (root) folder, with all subfolders, with extension to a single destination directory. 
Using MD5 hash checksum, to verify content not already there. (duplicate.)

created to have all my old backups, finally merged together.

extension, seems to be case sensitve, will need to adjust it.
